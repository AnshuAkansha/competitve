array
1.collection of items at continous memory location
2.same datatype are stored together
int arr[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
3.array has index with it
4.access array
arr[0] is the index of element to be accessed


5.code
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
int arr[5];
arr[0]=4;
arr[1]=2;
arr[2]=-10;
arr[3]=9;
arr[7]=21;
cout<<arr[3]<<endl;


// output of this much code -10

int arr1[5]={4,3,-10,9,21,12}; 
int arr2[]={5,3,12,6,9,43,33,56};

cout<<arr1[5]<<endl;
cout<<arr2[1]<<endl;
cout<<arr2[3/2]<<endl;

//output of above code is 12
//output of arr2 in above code is 3
//array always take floor value 3

int a[5] ={0};
cout<<a[4]<<endl;

//output 0

int a[5]={1};
cout<<a[4]<<endl;

//output 0 as this thing is valid for only 0 that assigning all element become 0
